If you were implementing a sort algorithm for a new language, which sort would you use and why?

&nbsp;I would choose Quick Sort to implement a sorting algorithm due to its average-case time complexity of O(n log n), practical efficiency with low overhead, and in-place sorting capability. It performs well on most real-world datasets, making it an excellent general-purpose choice for various applications.&nbsp;

Which sort algorithm has an easier implementation (in terms of understanding) to you and why?&nbsp;

For me,&nbsp;Insertion Sort is easier to implement and understand. Its logic is simple, it builds a sorted list by inserting each element into its correct position one at a time, much like sorting a hand of cards. This step-by-step approach feels intuitive and is easy to visualize. On the other hand, Bubble Sort&nbsp;involves repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements, which can feel less intuitive and more repetitive. Insertion Sort's clarity and straightforward process make it easier to implement and debug, especially for small or partially sorted datasets.
